Overview

The aim of this project is to provide data analysis of the Covid-19 pandemic (which started in the 2019). By using the analyzed data various graph were plotted to reveal spread trend of the virus. Also, the analysis shows clearly countries with high volume of recorded cases of the Pandemic. Again, after a careful study and analysis the data from various countries are combined using various graph chat to show the growth rate of the cases and the recovery rate.
